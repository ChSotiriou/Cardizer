<!-- Replace Dankort with the card you want -->
<!--Fill the table as per the wiki link or any other valid soure-->

Hello,

I would like to be able to generate randomize valid Dankort card.

| Issuing network | IIN ranges | Active | Length |  Validation |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Dankort | 5019 & 4571 (Visa co-branded) | Yes | 16 | Luhn |

<!-- You dont have to implement the card yourself, but if you want to look into, check this how-to guide: https://github.com/d-edge/Cardizer/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-new-card -->
